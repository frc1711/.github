# The Raptor Repos

## 👋 Hi there

Welcome to the code base for FRC Team 1711 The Raptors!

## 🙋‍ Who we are

FRC Team 1711 The Raptors is a First Robotics Competition team started in 2006
at Traverse City Central Highschool, in Traverse City Michigan.  You can find
more about the [Raptors at our website](https://raptors1711.com/), and some of
our accomplishments [on our Blue Alliance history page](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1711/history).

## 🗂️ Primary Repos

* [CLAW](https://github.com/frc1711/CLAW) - The FRC 1711 library for WPILibJ robot projects.
* [Team documentation and resources](https://github.com/frc1711/documentation)
* Future scouting app.
* [raptors1711.com website](https://github.com/frc1711/raptors1711.com)

## 🥅 Goals

* 👩‍💻 Becoming better programmers.  Not in only wpilib robotics programming,
  but website development, app development.
* 📖 Sharing what we learn.
* Documenting our processes and procedures. 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty
  things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
* Establishing and following our team [Coding Conventions](/profile/coding-conventions.md).
* Using _**Git**_ and _**GitHub**_ better.  We need more people writting code for the robot.  How do we do that?  We have them using version control and submitting their code back into the current years robot repo.
